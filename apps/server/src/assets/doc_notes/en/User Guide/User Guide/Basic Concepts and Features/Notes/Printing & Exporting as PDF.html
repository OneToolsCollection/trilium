<h2>Printing</h2>
<p>This feature allows printing of notes. It works on both the desktop client,
  but also on the web.</p>
<p>Note that not all note types are printable as of now. We do plan to increase
  the coverage of supported note types in the future.</p>
<p>To print a note, select the
  <img src="1_Printing & Exporting as PD.png"
  width="29" height="31">button to the right of the note and select <em>Print note</em>. Depending
  on the size and type of the note, this can take up to a few seconds. Afterwards
  you will be redirected to the system/browser printing dialog.</p>
<aside
class="admonition note">
  <p>Printing and exporting as PDF are not perfect. Due to technical limitations,
    and sometimes even browser glitches the text might appear cut off in some
    circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
  </aside>
  <h2>Reporting issues with the rendering</h2>
  <p>Should you encounter any visual issues in the resulting PDF file (e.g.
    a table does not fit properly, there is cut off text, etc.) feel free to
    <a
    href="#root/_help_wy8So3yZZlH9">report the issue</a>. In this case, it's best to offer a sample note (click
      on the
      <img src="1_Printing & Exporting as PD.png" width="29" height="31">button, select Export note → This note and all of its descendants → HTML
      in ZIP archive). Make sure not to accidentally leak any personal information.</p>
  <p>Consider adjusting font sizes and using <a href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/KSZ04uQ2D1St/iPIMuisry3hd/_help_CohkqWQC1iBv">page breaks</a> to
    work around the layout.</p>
  <h2>Exporting as PDF</h2>
  <p>On the desktop application of Trilium it is possible to export a note
    as PDF. On the server or PWA (mobile), the option is not available due
    to technical constraints and it will be hidden.</p>
  <p>To print a note, select the
    <img src="1_Printing & Exporting as PD.png">button to the right of the note and select <em>Export as PDF</em>. Afterwards
    you will be prompted to select where to save the PDF file.</p>
  <h3>Automatic opening of the file</h3>
  <p>When the PDF is exported, it is automatically opened with the system default
    application for easy preview.</p>
  <p>Note that if you are using Linux with the GNOME desktop environment, sometimes
    the default application might seem incorrect (such as opening in GIMP).
    This is because it uses Gnome's “Recommended applications” list.</p>
  <p>To solve this, you can change the recommended application for PDFs via
    this command line. First, list the available applications via <code>gio mime application/pdf</code> and
    then set the desired one. For example to use GNOME's Evince:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">gio mime application/pdf</code></pre>
  <h3>Customizing exporting as PDF</h3>
  <p>When exporting to PDF, there are no customizable settings such as page
    orientation, size. However, there are a few&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/tC7s2alapj8V/_help_zEY4DaJG4YT5">Attributes</a>&nbsp;to
    adjust some of the settings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li data-list-item-id="e76a765fe309058890d4f4d3e63bca578">To print in landscape mode instead of portrait (useful for big diagrams
      or slides), add <code>#printLandscape</code>.</li>
    <li data-list-item-id="e78123a3a12954d7c9f520f4e75ed375d">By default, the resulting PDF will be in Letter format. It is possible
      to adjust it to another page size via the <code>#printPageSize</code> attribute,
      with one of the following values: <code>A0</code>, <code>A1</code>, <code>A2</code>, <code>A3</code>, <code>A4</code>, <code>A5</code>, <code>A6</code>, <code>Legal</code>, <code>Letter</code>, <code>Tabloid</code>, <code>Ledger</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="admonition note">
    <p>These options have no effect when used with the printing feature, since
      the user-defined settings are used instead.</p>

  <h2>Keyboard shortcut</h2>

    by going to&nbsp;<em>Keyboard shortcuts</em>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"

  <h2>Under the hood</h2>
  <p>Both printing and exporting as PDF use the same mechanism: a note is rendered
    individually in a separate webpage that is then sent to the browser or
    the Electron application either for printing or exporting as PDF.</p>
  <p>The webpage that renders a single note can actually be accessed in a web
    browser. For example <code>http://localhost:8080/#root/WWRGzqHUfRln/RRZsE9Al8AIZ?ntxId=0o4fzk</code> becomes <code>http://localhost:8080/?print#root/WWRGzqHUfRln/RRZsE9Al8AIZ</code>.</p>
  <p>Accessing the print note in a web browser allows for easy debugging to
    understand why a particular note doesn't render well. The mechanism for
    rendering is similar to the one used in&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
